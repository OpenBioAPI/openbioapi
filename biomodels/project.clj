(defproject bio-models "v1.0"
  :description "<p>BioModels is a repository of mathematical models of biological and biomedical systems. It hosts a vast selection of existing literature-based physiologically and pharmaceutically relevant mechanistic models in standard formats. Our mission is to provide the systems modelling community with reproducible, high-quality, <a href='http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/' target='_blank'>freely-accessible</a> models published in the scientific literature. More information about BioModels can be found in the <a href='../faq'>FAQ</a>.</p> <h3>Notes about this API</h3> <h4 id='contentNegotiation'>Content negotiation</h4> <p>Both XML and JSON MIME types are supported. Clients have two ways of specifying the content type: <ul> <li>an explicit format request parameter (e.g. format=xml)</li> <li>the Accept request header (e.g. Accept: application/xml).</li> </ul> If both are specified, the format parameter has priority. </p> <h4>BioModels content</h4> <p>Model information is retrieved based on the a submission identifier, such as MODEL1707110000, or a BioModels identifier, like BIOMD0000000123. BioModels content is versioned and model revision numbers are assigned incrementally starting from 1. If a particular model revision is public, it can be accessed by appending a dot ('.') and its number to the model identifier (e.g. BIOMD0000000123.1). </p> <p><h4>Path2Models</h4></p>Models from the <a href='../path2models' target='_blank' title='find out more about Path2Models -- link opens in a new window'>Path2Models</a> project are now clustered based on their genus. Each Path2Models entry now consists of a representative model and a COMBINE archive of all other models whose organisms belong to that genus. As a result of this shuffle, some models are no longer directly accessible and such requests are redirected to the corresponding representative model. There are dedicated end points for checking which models are now only retrievable indirectly and also to find the representative model(s) for a given set of model identifiers.</p>"
